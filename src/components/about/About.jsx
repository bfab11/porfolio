                <p className="about-desc">Hi, I'm Brandon! A full-stack web developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular as well as back-end development with 
                node.js, express, and MongoDB. I have always been a fan of puzzles, problem-solving, and brain games. I like to enjoy my spare time playing Soduku, solving puzzles, video games, and 
                dancing. I've always had a knack of solving problems, which fortunately is what coding consists a lot of! And with that, web development was something that I quickly became fond of. 
                Along with developing, I also really enjoy designing! As a former Hip Hop dancer, I've always had a creative mind and an eye for what's innovative and appealing. As I made the
                transition, I quickly discovered how transferable those skills were to web development.

                {/* Coming from a background in customer service, I have developed a strong sense of intuitiveness and the ability to cater to my clientsâ€™ needs. 
                While also being a dance teacher, I understand the importance of being able to connect and appeal to different types of users. As someone who has always enjoyed puzzles and word 
                problems, I have the tools and drive to tackle any issue that stands in my way of coding. With these skills, I am excited to start developing beautiful and dynamic applications 
                for my clients. */}
